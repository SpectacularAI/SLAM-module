## License

This SLAM module is based on OpenVSLAM, which was initially claimed by its authors to be licensed under a BSD-style permissive license, but later taken offline due to possible GPL-licensing violation in connection to the ORB-SLAM codebase. Therefore, this module is not suitable for commercial use, see the file `openvslam/README.md` for more details.
